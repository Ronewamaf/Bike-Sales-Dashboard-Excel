Bike-Sales-Dashboard-Excel

I developed an interactive dashboard to analyze customer demographics and factors influencing bike purchases. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, creating pivot tables, and building dynamic data visualizations to uncover insights from the Bike Buyers 2022 dataset.

Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the demographic and lifestyle factors that influence whether a customer purchases a bike. By understanding customer behavior, the business can identify its key target audience and improve marketing strategies to boost bike sales.

What is the relationship between commute distance and bike purchases?

Do marital status and number of children affect bike purchases?

Which education and occupation groups are more likely to purchase bikes?

Regional contribution: Which region has the highest bike buyers?

Process

Data Preprocessing → Verified raw data for missing values, duplicates, and anomalies.

Data Cleaning → Formatted data types (e.g., numeric income, grouped age ranges).

Pivot Tables → Created pivot tables to answer KPI questions.

Data Visualization → Built charts to visualize gender, income, age, and commute trends.

Project Insights

Gender: Males are slightly more likely to purchase bikes compared to females.

Age Group: Middle-aged adults (31–50 years) contribute the most bike purchases.

Income: Customers with higher incomes (>$50,000) are more likely to buy bikes.

Commute Distance: Short commutes (0–5 miles) show higher bike purchase rates.

Marital Status: Married individuals tend to buy more bikes.

Region: The Pacific and Europe regions contribute the highest number of bike buyers.

Occupation: Professionals and skilled manual workers are the top buyer groups.

Final Conclusion

To increase bike sales, businesses should focus on middle-aged professionals and married individuals with higher income levels, particularly in the Pacific and Europe regions. Marketing campaigns should emphasize the convenience of bikes for short commutes (0–5 miles).
